I'm a Computer Science and Math undergraduate student. I'm on the hunt for interesting opportunities in Software Engineering, especially ones related to business/financial services and AI, that challenge me as a programmer and allow me to grow my skill set.

âš¡I've worked on the back-end Software Engineering team under Axon Vibe where we managed traffic and voucher campaign services for major public transport operators including MTA New York and DB Regio.

ðŸ”­ My interests include cutting-edge technologies, their applications, and their socioeconomic/humanitarian impacts.

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: Before college, I took a gap year to explore my interests and work for [Passerelles numÃ©riques](https://www.passerellesnumeriques.org/) (super cool non-profit that provides free IT training and industry support to underprivileged students), which led me down the tech path.

ðŸŒ± I don't debug 24/7. In my downtime, I like to travel places to take film photography, play my piano, or indulge myself in good podcasts/blogs/books for inspirations. Would love to hear any recommendations also! 

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:hannguyen0712@gmail.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannguyen0712/).
