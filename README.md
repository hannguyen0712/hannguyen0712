I'm a Computer Science and Math undergraduate student. I'm on the hunt for interesting SWE and AL/ML opportunities that challenge me as a programmer and allow me to grow my skill set. I'm especially interested in business/financial softwares, and I'm also curious about different exciting products out there.

âš¡ I've had experiences building a RAG workflow for [Paqt](https://paqt.chat/) worked on the back-end Software Engineering team under Axon Vibe where we managed traffic and voucher campaign services for major public transport operators including MTA New York and DB Regio.

ðŸ”­ My interests include cutting-edge technologies, their applications, and their socioeconomic/humanitarian impacts.

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: Before college, I took a gap year to explore my interests and worked for [Passerelles numÃ©riques](https://www.passerellesnumeriques.org/) (super cool non-profit that provides free IT training and industry support to underprivileged students), which led me down my current tech path.

ðŸŒ± In my downtime, I like to travel places to take film photography, play my piano, or learn from good podcasts/blogs/books. Would love to hear any recommendations! 


I'm best reached via [email](mailto:hannguyen0712@gmail.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannguyen0712/). I'm always open for interesting conversations, collaborations, and opportunities.
